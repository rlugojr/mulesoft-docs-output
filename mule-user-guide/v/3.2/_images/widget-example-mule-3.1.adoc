|image:warning.png[warning] |These are instructions for running the Widget example in Mule 3.1. To run it in Mile 3.2, see link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Widget+Example[here].

|===

This example illustrates the use of Mule's link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Mule+High+Availability[High Availability (HA)] module for failover.

== Running the example

. Prepare 2 Mule installations (1 primary, 1 backup) with HA enabled as explained link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Mule+High+Availability[here].
. From one (and only one) of the Mule installations, run the command line client (`widget.sh` / `widget.bat`) which is in the `examples/widget` directory, this will start up a JMS server used by both Mule instances (if you start up more than one you will get port conflicts).
. Deploy the pre-built widget application (`mule-example-widget.zip`) to the `$MULE_HOME/apps` directory of both Mule installations and wait for them to start up.
. The widget factory is now in a ready state. You should see that the services of the primary Mule instance are started, but the services of the backup instance are stopped.

== Testing the example

. From the command line client, send some widgets to be manufactured, you should see them being processed by the primary instance but not the backup instance.
. Now simulate a failure of the primary instance (e.g., `Ctrl-C` from the Mule console or `kill -9` with the Mule process ID)
. You should see the backup instance detect the primary node failure and its services start up.
. Send some more widgets to be manufactured, you should now see them being processed by the backup instance.
. Simulate a recovery of the primary instance (start up Mule again).
. You should see that the instance starts up, but its services are stopped because the primary instance has now become the new backup.
