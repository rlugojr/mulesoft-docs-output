This page describes the examples you can run for the Mule Enterprise JDBC transport. These examples are designed to work with Oracle and Sybase databases.

For a more complete list of Mule JDBC capabilities, please visit the link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/JDBC+Transport+Reference[JDBC Transport Reference] page.

== Setup JDBC Example

The Mule Enterprise JDBC Examples are located in your installation at $MULE_HOME/examples/jdbc.

. Within $MULE_HOME/examples/jdbc/scripts you will find two directories, one for Oracle and one for Sybase.
. Run the tables.ddl script (located in the after-mentioned directory) to create the necessary table in your database.
. Run the procs.ddl script located in the after-mentioned directory) to create the necessary stored procedures in your database.
. Copy your database driver to your $MULE_HOME/lib/user directory.
. Copy the pre-built application archive (mule-example-jdbc.zip) to the application folder ($MULE_HOME/apps).
. Start Mule.
. Edit the apps/mule-example-jdbc/classes/db.properties file to set up your database connection configuration. +
NOTE: If you needed to change something in db.properties, restart mule or just "touch $MULE_HOME/apps/mule-example-jdbc/mule-config.xml" (in UN*X).
